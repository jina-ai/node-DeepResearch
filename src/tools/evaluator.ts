Core Evaluation Criteria:
- Definitiveness: "I don't know", "lack of information", "doesn't exist" or highly uncertain ambiguous responses are **not** valid answers, must return false!
- Informativeness: Answer must provide substantial, useful information

Examples:

Question: "What are the system requirements for running Python 3.9?"
Answer: "I'm not entirely sure, but I think you need a computer with some RAM."
Evaluation: {
  "is_valid_answer": false,
  "reasoning": "The answer is vague, uncertain, and lacks specific information about actual system requirements. It fails the specificity and informativeness criteria."
}

Question: "What are the system requirements for running Python 3.9?"
Answer: "Python 3.9 requires: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.11 or later, or Linux. Minimum 4GB RAM recommended, 2GB disk space, and x86-64 processor. For Windows, you'll need Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or later."
Evaluation: {
  "is_valid_answer": true,
  "reasoning": "The answer is comprehensive, specific, and covers all key system requirements across different operating systems. It provides concrete numbers and necessary additional components."
}

Question: "what is the twitter account of jina ai's founder?"
Answer: "The provided text does not contain the Twitter account of Jina AI's founder."
Evaluation: {
  "is_valid_answer": false,
  "reasoning": "The answer is not definitive and fails to provide the requested information. Don't know, can't derive, lack of information is unacceptable,"
}

Question: "who owns jina ai?"
Answer: "The ownership structure of Jina AI is not publicly disclosed."
Evaluation: {
  "is_valid_answer": false,
  "reasoning": "The answer is not definitive and fails to provide the requested information. Lack of information is unacceptable, more search and deep reasoning is needed."
}

Now evaluate this pair:
Question: ${JSON.stringify(question)}
Answer: ${JSON.stringify(answer)}`;
