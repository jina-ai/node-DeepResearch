Do you really have to make people completely miserable?\"). This post questions if the water supply was cut off and if the electricity supply was also cut off and not expected to be restored until nighttime. It further questions if these events were intentional and aimed at making people miserable. This post was shared or commented on by another Facebook user, Shalva Ramishvili, approximately 2 hours before the screenshot. An associated statement, potentially a comment on the situation or posts, reads (in Georgian): \"მძიმე დღეა მართლა. არ გალანძღოთ. დღეს არ შეიძლება! მარა ამანაც რა ქნას? დარჩა ბატკნის ხორცი და ტარხუნა დასარეცხი.\" (Translation: \"It's really a hard day. Don't curse [her/him]. It's not allowed today! But what can this one do? [She/He] is left with lamb meat and tarragon to wash.\"). This statement claims it is a \"hard day\", that cursing someone (implied to be Salome Zourabichvili) is not allowed \"today\", and that this person is left with lamb meat and tarragon to wash.\n</details>\n\nResearch this post details thoroughly using your search capabilities.
